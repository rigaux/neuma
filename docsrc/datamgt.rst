Managing corpuses
*****************

By clicking to the "Management" tab, one obtain the forms shown on  
:numref:`manageCorpus`.

        Managing a corpus and its sub-corpuses

The following actions are 
proposed

  - Editing the corpus, to change its description
  - Adding a sub-corpus
  - Adding a zip file containing a list of opuses to import in the corpus
  - Importing a zip file
  
Editing corpuses
================

The *Edit corpus* form is shown on :numref:`editCorpus`. 
This form can be used for creating and 
editing (modifying) corpuses.

.. _editCorpus:
.. figure:: ./figures/editCorpus.png       
        :width: 90%
        :align: center
   
        Corpus form 
        
Fields:

 - title, for the main page of the corpus
 - short title, used for lists and links
 - description
 - short description (a few lines) 
 - ``isPublic``: a corpus can be either *Public* (not access restrictions) or *Private*. In the
   latter case it is shown only to users with access grants.
 - Parent corpus: each corpus has a unique parent. Choose the parent from the list
 - Reference code: this is the *global* reference code, for instance ``composers:bach:chorals``
   for the ``chorals`` corpus, child of ``bach``, itself child of ``composers``. **Be very careful**
   when entering the reference, because its is essential to ensure the consistency of 
   navigation and searches in Neuma.
 - The cover is an image that illustrates the corpus.

Managing opuses
***************

Like corpuses, opuses can be edited via the Django admin form. This form can be accessed, for
connected users with access rights, thanks to a small pen displayed left of the opus title.

However, in general opuses are managed in batches. The main procedure consists in importing
(and exporting) Zip files containing opuses contents. 

For data exchanges, all infos related to an opus are gathered in two files

 - The score, either a MusicXML (and its compressed variant) or MEI 
 - (Optional) metadata sotred in a Json file.
 
For XML files (scores), three extensions are accepted:  'xml' for MusicXML, 'mxl' 
for compressed MusicXML, and 'mei' for MEI.
     
Both files are named accoding to the (local) reference of the opus, for instance 
``bwv333.xml`` for the MusicXML file of choral BWV333, and ``bwv333.json`` for metadata.
The Json file is optional: if absent, the import procedure attempts to extract metadata from
the XML file. 

Upload files
============

.. note:: In the ``data`` directory of Neuma, you will find that Zip files ready to be imported.

For import/export, opuses are gathered in Zip files. In order to create such a file, proceed as follows

  - create a directory (its name is not important), say ``myImport``;
  - put the opuses files in this directory. It is essential to respect the naming
    rules explained above. 
  - compress the directory as a zip file, e.g., ``myImport.zip``.
    
**Be careful with opus references**: the file names (without extension)
define the local reference of an opus inside its corpus. if, for instance,
one imports in a corpus ``psautiers:godeau1656``, then a file 
``mynopus.xml`` will be imported in the corpus with (globl) reference 
``psautiers:godeau1656:monopus``.

Opus references cannot be modified after import.  **Use a consistent naming scheme,
in lowercase, as short as possible**. Note that opuses are sorted
on their (local) reference whenever a corpus is displayed. This must be anticipated
if order is important. For instance,  
``opus_1``  appears before ``opus_2`` in alphanumeric order, ,
but the latter  appears *after* ``opus_12``. Use padding 0 to obtain a correct sorting,
such as ``opus_01``,
``opus_02``, `Ã²pus_12`` (in case two  positions are enough).

Inserting upload files
======================

In the *Management* tab of a corpus, a form allows to upload a zip file. You must supply
a sort description of the Zip content, and the Zip file itself. 

Once uploaded, Zip files appear in a list, left of the *Management* tab. Note the ID of a
file which is required to trigger its insertion.

The Django admin form gives additional access to upload files (deletion, replacement, etc.)

Importing opuses
================

In order to bulkload the content of a ZIP file, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 manage.py import_zip -u <upload_id>
 
This function can be run in asynchronous mode with:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 manage.py import_zip -u <upload_id> -a 1
