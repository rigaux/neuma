The chapter describes the management or roles and
access rights. Neuma recognizes four role: *anonymous* (not connected), 
*visitor*, *editor* and *administrator*.

Access rights operate at the corpus level. They
can be split in *view* and *edit*. Editing means
both creation, and modification (which includes the right to 
add opuses to a corpus), but not deletion.

Recall that a corpus has
a visibility status which is either *public* or *private*. 
Access rights depend  on both this status and on user's role.
The rules are essentially the following:

  - Anonymous users can *see* public corpuses, but cannot edit them ; they do not see private corpuses
  -
