NEUMA is a digital library that aims at publishing on-line 
corpora of music. We maintain and develop collections of scores 
with a clear and flexible organization based on interrelated 
corpus, so that users can easily browse, search and access 
them. NEUMA is also an open platform: as an authorized  user, 
you can get an account, create your own corpus and 
enrich them with new scores, annotate existing scores, and, 
overall, contribute to the collaborative effort of publishing 
hardly accessible music works.

This documentation is intended as a guide for users of the 
Neuma digital library. It covers in details data organization, data
management, user management, and services.

At the time of writing, Neuma is accessible at https://neuma.huma-num.fr.
